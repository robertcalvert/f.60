About
-----

The f.60 is an open hardware 60% mechanical keyboard.

The board has a standard 62 key ISO layout designed for [Cherry MX](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX) switches. To avoid [ghosting](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Rollover,_blocking_and_ghosting#Ghosting) each switch has an associated diode. The [1N4148](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1N4148_signal_diode) is a common choice; however any signal diode should work.

The board is designed for a [Teensy 2.0](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html) micro controller.
